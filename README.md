# GTA V Gameconfig.xml

Add-on mods in GTA V typically require a modified gameconfig.xml to increase various memory pool limits. 
This repository serves as a central location for known-working gameconfig files for each GTA V update.
Files based on [gameconfig releases by Dilapidated on gta5-mods](https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/gameconfig-xml-dilapidated).

The [versions](versions) folder has a folder for each supported GTA V build number, containing the gameconfig.xml for 
that game version. For the latest game version, check the [releases](https://github.com/pnwparksfan/gameconfig/releases).
